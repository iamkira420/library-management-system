## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile

This project uses multiple `.cpp` and `.h` files. To compile using `g++`, run:
```
g++ main.cpp LibraryManager.cpp LibraryItem.cpp Book.cpp Magazine.cpp -o library
```

# How to Run 
```
./library
```
You will see a menu-based interface to interact with the library system. Feast!
